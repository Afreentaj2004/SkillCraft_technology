The Temperature Converter is a straightforward Java program that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It provides a command-line interface where users can choose a conversion option, enter a temperature value, and receive the converted result. The program includes six conversion options, covering all conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin, ensuring flexibility and accuracy for various needs. Each conversion is handled by separate methods, making the code modular, easy to read, and efficient for both beginners and more experienced Java users.

To use the program, users simply compile `iu.java` with `javac iu.java` and run it with `java iu` in the terminal. The program then prompts for a conversion type and temperature input, displaying the result immediately. This makes it an ideal tool for quick, offline temperature conversions. The Temperature Converter is also a helpful learning project for Java students, showcasing concepts like methods, user input, and conditional statements in a practical, hands-on way.

No special setup is required beyond having Java 8 or higher installed, which can be checked with `java -version`. With its simplicity and clear functionality, this converter is useful for students, developers, and anyone who occasionally needs a quick way to switch between temperature units. Future improvements could include adding a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience, additional temperature units, or error-handling features to handle invalid inputs. This project, as it stands, is a reliable and accessible tool for essential temperature conversions.
